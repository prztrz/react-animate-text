Actually it does not need to be text, you can pass any react composition, `react-animate-text` will animate text in order of they apperance. Styles and other attributes will be preserved

```js
import TextAnimation from 'react-animate-text';

<TextAnimation>
  <main>
    <h1>This is header</h1>
    <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>Exciting styled text</span>
    <div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <span>Man it is nested!</span>
        </div>
      </div>
